First and foremost, I love writing code. Ever since writing my first program in .Net and manipulating it to produce a desired output, I have been obsessed with the idea of using software to solve practical problems. Software development is a never-ending puzzle that I am passionately engaged in solving. I believe in the power of programming to transform and improve the lives of people around the world.

Something that I love about programming is the opportunity to work with people from a wide range of disciplines. The software development lifecycle involves working with so many different people and departments and, as a people person and someone who loves to build new relationships, itâ€™s great to be able to come together with other professionals who are striving towards the same goal.

Yes, i am a programmer specialising in the app development arena. For the last 6 years, I have been developing software using different technologies.

I leave some of the projects I've been involved in here for you. But that's not all, of course. ðŸ˜‹
